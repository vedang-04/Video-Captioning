# Video-Captioning
Creating a video captioning model using the MLDS_hw2_data data.

In the data we have the training dataset which contains videos and extracted features. In the test dataset we have the same.
Apart from this in the dataset folder we have training labels as the captions for training dataset videos and their extracted features.
We also have a .py file to evaluate the # BLEU Score

Get the dataset from https://gitlab.com/hsiaoyi0504/MLDS_HW2_data/tree/master/
